# Basic-Website-Design-Flask
A basic website designed using custom HTML templates and CSS stylesheets and rendered as a microservice in Python using the popular Flask library. 

## A Simple Data Analytics Portal

The aim of the website is to provide some basic online Data Analytics functionalities like Dataset Exploration, Visualization, Feature Inspection/Selection and some basic re-trainable Classification/Predictive Models. 

Here we use the **[Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)** for demonstration purposes.

**P.S. :** The website is still in Work-in-Progress and hence **still incomplete**.
